A movie app

## `npm install`

Go to both root and server folders, type the above command in the terminal to install the dependencies.

## `npm start`

Go to the `src` folder and run the above command to start the React app.

## `npm run devStart`

Go to the `server` folder and run the above command to start the development server using `nodemon`.

Alternatively, you can start the server using `npm run start` too, but it doesn't have `nodemon` dependency, which refreshes the server, whenever there are any changes in the files.
